# Goddon - The wow addon installer in the terminal

Goddon is a small passion project to install addons for wow from the terminal with cli commands.

## Why?

Because Wago, CF and Wowup all have ads, and we all hate ads.

## How?

Using Go and the power of cli tools, us nerds can just use a simple command or 2 to update, install or uninstall an addon.
